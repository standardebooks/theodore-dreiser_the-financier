<p>
The days passed. Once the understanding with Bonhag was reached,
Cowperwood’s wife, mother and sister were allowed to appear on occasions.
His wife and the children were now settled in the little home for which he was
paying, and his financial obligations to her were satisfied by Wingate, who
paid her one hundred and twenty five dollars a month for him. He realized that
he owed her more, but he was sailing rather close to the wind financially,
these days. The final collapse of his old interests had come in March, when he
had been legally declared a bankrupt, and all his properties forfeited to
satisfy the claims against him. The city’s claim of five hundred thousand
dollars would have eaten up more than could have been realized at the time, had
not a pro rata payment of thirty cents on the dollar been declared. Even then
the city never received its due, for by some hocus-pocus it was declared to
have forfeited its rights. Its claims had not been made at the proper time in
the proper way. This left larger portions of real money for the others.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately by now Cowperwood had begun to see that by a little experimenting
his business relations with Wingate were likely to prove profitable. The broker
had made it clear that he intended to be perfectly straight with him. He had
employed Cowperwood’s two brothers, at very moderate salaries—one
to take care of the books and look after the office, and the other to act on
’change with him, for their seats in that organization had never been
sold. And also, by considerable effort, he had succeeded in securing
Cowperwood, Sr., a place as a clerk in a bank. For the latter, since the day of
his resignation from the Third National had been in a deep, sad quandary as to
what further to do with his life. His son’s disgrace! The horror of his
trial and incarceration. Since the day of Frank’s indictment and more so,
since his sentence and commitment to the Eastern Penitentiary, he was as one
who walked in a dream. That trial! That charge against Frank! His own son, a
convict in stripes—and after he and Frank had walked so proudly in the
front rank of the successful and respected here. Like so many others in his
hour of distress, he had taken to reading the Bible, looking into its pages for
something of that mind consolation that always, from youth up, although rather
casually in these latter years, he had imagined was to be found there. The
Psalms, Isaiah, the Book of Job, Ecclesiastes. And for the most part, because
of the fraying nature of his present ills, not finding it.
</p>
<p>
But day after day secreting himself in his room—a little hall-bedroom
office in his newest home, where to his wife, he pretended that he had some
commercial matters wherewith he was still concerned—and once inside, the
door locked, sitting and brooding on all that had befallen him—his
losses; his good name. Or, after months of this, and because of the new
position secured for him by Wingate—a bookkeeping job in one of the
outlying banks—slipping away early in the morning, and returning late at
night, his mind a gloomy epitome of all that had been or yet might be.
</p>
<p>
To see him bustling off from his new but very much reduced home at half after
seven in the morning in order to reach the small bank, which was some distance
away and not accessible by street-car line, was one of those pathetic sights
which the fortunes of trade so frequently offer. He carried his lunch in a
small box because it was inconvenient to return home in the time allotted for
this purpose, and because his new salary did not permit the extravagance of a
purchased one. It was his one ambition now to eke out a respectable but unseen
existence until he should die, which he hoped would not be long. He was a
pathetic figure with his thin legs and body, his gray hair, and his snow-white
side-whiskers. He was very lean and angular, and, when confronted by a
difficult problem, a little uncertain or vague in his mind. An old habit which
had grown on him in the years of his prosperity of putting his hand to his
mouth and of opening his eyes in an assumption of surprise, which had no basis
in fact, now grew upon him. He really degenerated, although he did not know it,
into a mere automaton. Life strews its shores with such interesting and
pathetic wrecks.
</p>
<p>
One of the things that caused Cowperwood no little thought at this time, and
especially in view of his present extreme indifference to her, was how he would
bring up this matter of his indifference to his wife and his desire to end
their relationship. Yet apart from the brutality of the plain truth, he saw no
way. As he could plainly see, she was now persisting in her pretense of
devotion, uncolored, apparently, by any suspicion of what had happened. Yet
since his trial and conviction, she had been hearing from one source and
another that he was still intimate with Aileen, and it was only her thought of
his concurrent woes, and the fact that he might possibly be spared to a
successful financial life, that now deterred her from speaking. He was shut up
in a cell, she said to herself, and she was really very sorry for him, but she
did not love him as she once had. He was really too deserving of reproach for
his general unseemly conduct, and no doubt this was what was intended, as well
as being enforced, by the Governing Power of the world.
</p>
<p>
One can imagine how much such an attitude as this would appeal to Cowperwood,
once he had detected it. By a dozen little signs, in spite of the fact that she
brought him delicacies, and commiserated on his fate, he could see that she
felt not only sad, but reproachful, and if there was one thing that Cowperwood
objected to at all times it was the moral as well as the funereal air.
Contrasted with the cheerful combative hopefulness and enthusiasm of Aileen,
the wearied uncertainty of Mrs. Cowperwood was, to say the least, a little
tame. Aileen, after her first burst of rage over his fate, which really did not
develop any tears on her part, was apparently convinced that he would get out
and be very successful again. She talked success and his future all the time
because she believed in it. Instinctively she seemed to realize that prison
walls could not make a prison for him. Indeed, on the first day she left she
handed Bonhag ten dollars, and after thanking him in her attractive
voice—without showing her face, however—for his obvious kindness to
her, bespoke his further favor for Cowperwood—“a very great
man,” as she described him, which sealed that ambitious
materialist’s fate completely. There was nothing the overseer would not
do for the young lady in the dark cloak. She might have stayed in
Cowperwood’s cell for a week if the visiting-hours of the penitentiary
had not made it impossible.
</p>
<p>
The day that Cowperwood decided to discuss with his wife the weariness of his
present married state and his desire to be free of it was some four months
after he had entered the prison. By that time he had become inured to his
convict life. The silence of his cell and the menial tasks he was compelled to
perform, which had at first been so distressing, banal, maddening, in their
pointless iteration, had now become merely commonplace—dull, but not
painful. Furthermore he had learned many of the little resources of the
solitary convict, such as that of using his lamp to warm up some delicacy which
he had saved from a previous meal or from some basket which had been sent him
by his wife or Aileen. He had partially gotten rid of the sickening odor of his
cell by persuading Bonhag to bring him small packages of lime; which he used
with great freedom. Also he succeeded in defeating some of the more venturesome
rats with traps; and with Bonhag’s permission, after his cell door had
been properly locked at night, and sealed with the outer wooden door, he would
take his chair, if it were not too cold, out into the little back yard of his
cell and look at the sky, where, when the nights were clear, the stars were to
be seen. He had never taken any interest in astronomy as a scientific study,
but now the Pleiades, the belt of Orion, the Big Dipper and the North Star, to
which one of its lines pointed, caught his attention, almost his fancy. He
wondered why the stars of the belt of Orion came to assume the peculiar
mathematical relation to each other which they held, as far as distance and
arrangement were concerned, and whether that could possibly have any
intellectual significance. The nebulous conglomeration of the suns in Pleiades
suggested a soundless depth of space, and he thought of the earth floating like
a little ball in immeasurable reaches of ether. His own life appeared very
trivial in view of these things, and he found himself asking whether it was all
really of any significance or importance. He shook these moods off with ease,
however, for the man was possessed of a sense of grandeur, largely in relation
to himself and his affairs; and his temperament was essentially material and
vital. Something kept telling him that whatever his present state he must yet
grow to be a significant personage, one whose fame would be heralded the world
over—who must try, try, try. It was not given all men to see far or to do
brilliantly; but to him it was given, and he must be what he was cut out to be.
There was no more escaping the greatness that was inherent in him than there
was for so many others the littleness that was in them.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Cowperwood came in that afternoon quite solemnly, bearing several changes
of linen, a pair of sheets, some potted meat and a pie. She was not exactly
doleful, but Cowperwood thought that she was tending toward it, largely because
of her brooding over his relationship to Aileen, which he knew that she knew.
Something in her manner decided him to speak before she left; and after asking
her how the children were, and listening to her inquiries in regard to the
things that he needed, he said to her, sitting on his single chair while she
sat on his bed:
</p>
<p>
“Lillian, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk with
you about for some time. I should have done it before, but it’s better
late than never. I know that you know that there is something between Aileen
Butler and me, and we might as well have it open and aboveboard. It’s
true I am very fond of her and she is very devoted to me, and if ever I get out
of here I want to arrange it so that I can marry her. That means that you will
have to give me a divorce, if you will; and I want to talk to you about that
now. This can’t be so very much of a surprise to you, because you must
have seen this long while that our relationship hasn’t been all that it
might have been, and under the circumstances this can’t prove such a very
great hardship to you—I am sure.” He paused, waiting, for Mrs.
Cowperwood at first said nothing.
</p>
<p>
Her thought, when he first broached this, was that she ought to make some
demonstration of astonishment or wrath: but when she looked into his steady,
examining eyes, so free from the illusion of or interest in demonstrations of
any kind, she realized how useless it would be. He was so utterly
matter-of-fact in what seemed to her quite private and secret
affairs—very shameless. She had never been able to understand quite how
he could take the subtleties of life as he did, anyhow. Certain things which
she always fancied should be hushed up he spoke of with the greatest
nonchalance. Her ears tingled sometimes at his frankness in disposing of a
social situation; but she thought this must be characteristic of notable men,
and so there was nothing to be said about it. Certain men did as they pleased;
society did not seem to be able to deal with them in any way. Perhaps God
would, later—she was not sure. Anyhow, bad as he was, direct as he was,
forceful as he was, he was far more interesting than most of the more
conservative types in whom the social virtues of polite speech and modest
thoughts were seemingly predominate.
</p>
<p>
“I know,” she said, rather peacefully, although with a touch of
anger and resentment in her voice. “I’ve known all about it all
this time. I expected you would say something like this to me some day.
It’s a nice reward for all my devotion to you; but it’s just like
you, Frank. When you are set on something, nothing can stop you. It
wasn’t enough that you were getting along so nicely and had two children
whom you ought to love, but you had to take up with this Butler creature until
her name and yours are a by-word throughout the city. I know that she comes to
this prison. I saw her out here one day as I was coming in, and I suppose every
one else knows it by now. She has no sense of decency and she does not
care—the wretched, vain thing—but I would have thought that you
would be ashamed, Frank, to go on the way that you have, when you still have me
and the children and your father and mother and when you are certain to have
such a hard fight to get yourself on your feet, as it is. If she had any sense
of decency she would not have anything to do with you—the shameless
thing.”
</p>
<p>
Cowperwood looked at his wife with unflinching eyes. He read in her remarks
just what his observation had long since confirmed—that she was
sympathetically out of touch with him. She was no longer so attractive
physically, and intellectually she was not Aileen’s equal. Also that
contact with those women who had deigned to grace his home in his greatest hour
of prosperity had proved to him conclusively she was lacking in certain social
graces. Aileen was by no means so vastly better, still she was young and
amenable and adaptable, and could still be improved. Opportunity as he now
chose to think, might make Aileen, whereas for Lillian—or at least, as he
now saw it—it could do nothing.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you how it is, Lillian,” he said; “I’m
not sure that you are going to get what I mean exactly, but you and I are not
at all well suited to each other any more.”
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t seem to think that three or four years ago,”
interrupted his wife, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
“I married you when I was twenty-one,” went on Cowperwood, quite
brutally, not paying any attention to her interruption, “and I was really
too young to know what I was doing. I was a mere boy. It doesn’t make so
much difference about that. I am not using that as an excuse. The point that I
am trying to make is this—that right or wrong, important or not
important, I have changed my mind since. I don’t love you any more, and I
don’t feel that I want to keep up a relationship, however it may look to
the public, that is not satisfactory to me. You have one point of view about
life, and I have another. You think your point of view is the right one, and
there are thousands of people who will agree with you; but I don’t think
so. We have never quarreled about these things, because I didn’t think it
was important to quarrel about them. I don’t see under the circumstances
that I am doing you any great injustice when I ask you to let me go. I
don’t intend to desert you or the children—you will get a good
living-income from me as long as I have the money to give it to you—but I
want my personal freedom when I come out of here, if ever I do, and I want you
to let me have it. The money that you had and a great deal more, once I am out
of here, you will get back when I am on my feet again. But not if you oppose
me—only if you help me. I want, and intend to help you always—but
in my way.”
</p>
<p>
He smoothed the leg of his prison trousers in a thoughtful way, and plucked at
the sleeve of his coat. Just now he looked very much like a highly intelligent
workman as he sat here, rather than like the important personage that he was.
Mrs. Cowperwood was very resentful.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a nice way to talk to me, and a nice way to treat
me!” she exclaimed dramatically, rising and walking the short
space—some two steps—that lay between the wall and the bed.
“I might have known that you were too young to know your own mind when
you married me. Money, of course, that’s all you think of and your own
gratification. I don’t believe you have any sense of justice in you. I
don’t believe you ever had. You only think of yourself, Frank. I never
saw such a man as you. You have treated me like a dog all through this affair;
and all the while you have been running with that little snip of an Irish
thing, and telling her all about your affairs, I suppose. You let me go on
believing that you cared for me up to the last moment, and then you suddenly
step up and tell me that you want a divorce. I’ll not do it. I’ll
not give you a divorce, and you needn’t think it.”
</p>
<p>
Cowperwood listened in silence. His position, in so far as this marital tangle
was concerned, as he saw, was very advantageous. He was a convict, constrained
by the exigencies of his position to be out of personal contact with his wife
for a long period of time to come, which should naturally tend to school her to
do without him. When he came out, it would be very easy for her to get a
divorce from a convict, particularly if she could allege misconduct with
another woman, which he would not deny. At the same time, he hoped to keep
Aileen’s name out of it. Mrs. Cowperwood, if she would, could give any
false name if he made no contest. Besides, she was not a very strong person,
intellectually speaking. He could bend her to his will. There was no need of
saying much more now; the ice had been broken, the situation had been put
before her, and time should do the rest.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be dramatic, Lillian,” he commented, indifferently.
“I’m not such a loss to you if you have enough to live on. I
don’t think I want to live in Philadelphia if ever I come out of here. My
idea now is to go west, and I think I want to go alone. I sha’n’t
get married right away again even if you do give me a divorce. I don’t
care to take anybody along. It would be better for the children if you would
stay here and divorce me. The public would think better of them and you.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll not do it,” declared Mrs. Cowperwood, emphatically.
“I’ll never do it, never; so there! You can say what you choose.
You owe it to me to stick by me and the children after all I’ve done for
you, and I’ll not do it. You needn’t ask me any more; I’ll
not do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” replied Cowperwood, quietly, getting up. “We
needn’t talk about it any more now. Your time is nearly up,
anyhow.” (Twenty minutes was supposed to be the regular allotment for
visitors.) “Perhaps you’ll change your mind sometime.”
</p>
<p>
She gathered up her muff and the shawl-strap in which she had carried her
gifts, and turned to go. It had been her custom to kiss Cowperwood in a
make-believe way up to this time, but now she was too angry to make this
pretense. And yet she was sorry, too—sorry for herself and, she thought,
for him.
</p>
<p>
“Frank,” she declared, dramatically, at the last moment, “I
never saw such a man as you. I don’t believe you have any heart.
You’re not worthy of a good wife. You’re worthy of just such a
woman as you’re getting. The idea!” Suddenly tears came to her
eyes, and she flounced scornfully and yet sorrowfully out.
</p>
<p>
Cowperwood stood there. At least there would be no more useless kissing between
them, he congratulated himself. It was hard in a way, but purely from an
emotional point of view. He was not doing her any essential injustice, he
reasoned—not an economic one—which was the important thing. She was
angry to-day, but she would get over it, and in time might come to see his
point of view. Who could tell? At any rate he had made it plain to her what he
intended to do and that was something as he saw it. He reminded one of nothing
so much, as he stood there, as of a young chicken picking its way out of the
shell of an old estate. Although he was in a cell of a penitentiary, with
nearly four years more to serve, yet obviously he felt, within himself, that
the whole world was still before him. He could go west if he could not
reestablish himself in Philadelphia; but he must stay here long enough to win
the approval of those who had known him formerly—to obtain, as it were, a
letter of credit which he could carry to other parts.
</p>
<p>
“Hard words break no bones,” he said to himself, as his wife went
out. “A man’s never done till he’s done. I’ll show some
of these people yet.” Of Bonhag, who came to close the cell door, he
asked whether it was going to rain, it looked so dark in the hall.
</p>
<p>
“It’s sure to before night,” replied Bonhag, who was always
wondering over Cowperwood’s tangled affairs as he heard them retailed
here and there.
